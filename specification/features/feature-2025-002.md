### CR-2025-002: Wrong answer can not be unturned
- Requested by: Santanu Bhattacharya

### **Problem Summary**

- Currently, when a student answers a question incorrectly and later answers it correctly (because the question reappears), the system overwrites the old attempt.
- This produces incorrect dashboard results.
- The system must **retain every attempt**, not replace earlier ones.

### **New Requirement**

- Every student answer attempt must be recorded as a separate attempt.
- A later correct answer **does NOT cancel or remove** earlier wrong answers.
- Dashboard calculations must be based on **total attempts**, not unique questions.

------

### Impact

#### **1. Student Flow**

- Must allow multiple attempts for same question.
- Wrong answers must remain recorded.

#### **2. Answer Submission Logic**

- Instead of “update_or_create”, the system must **always INSERT a new attempt**.

#### **3. Dashboard Calculation**

- Count all attempts.
- Success rate = `total_correct / total_attempts * 100`.

------

### **Data Model Impact**

- `student_attempts` (or `submissions`) table must support:
  - multiple rows for same `(student_id, question_id)`
  - timestamps for chronological order

No uniqueness constraint should exist on this pair.

- Priority: High
- Example:
  There are 4 questions
  Student give wrong ansewr to first question
  Rest of the answers are correct
  In dashboard it should show: 4 attempted, 3 correct(success rate: 75%)
  Now the first question appear again
  Student give correct answer this time
  In dashboard it should show: 5 attempted, 4 correct(success rate: 80%)
